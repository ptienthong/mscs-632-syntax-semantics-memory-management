# Assignment 2: Syntax, Semantics, and Memory Management
This repo is a part of MSCS-632: Advanced Programming Language. It contains simple source codes for various programming languages including Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and Rust. The purpose of showing these codes is to see how each language feature deals with type system, scope, closure, and memory management.

## How to run codes
### Python
```
python3 python_semantics.py
```
### JavaScript
```
node javascript_semantics.js
```
### C++
```
./build/cpp_semantics
```
### Java
```
java MemoryManagement
```
### Rust
```
./build/rust_memory_management
